## Features

- **Token Transfer:** Users can transfer AKT tokens from one Ethereum address to another using the `transfer` function.
- **Token Minting:** The contract owner can mint new AKT tokens and assign them to a specific address using the `mint` function.
- **Token Burning:** Users can burn (destroy) their own AKT tokens using the `burn` function.
- **Ownership Control:** Certain functions are restricted to the contract owner using the `onlyOwner` modifier.

## Requirements

- Ethereum Wallet (e.g., MetaMask) for deploying and interacting with the contract.
- Solidity compiler (version 0.8.0 or compatible) for compiling the contract.

## Deployment

1. Compile the `AyushKumarToken.sol` contract using a Solidity compiler (e.g., Remix).
2. Deploy the compiled contract to the Ethereum network using an Ethereum wallet (e.g., Remix, Truffle, or Hardhat).

## Contract Details

- **Name:** AyushKumarToken
- **Symbol:** AKT
- **Decimals:** 21
- **Total Supply:** 980 * 10^21 (980 AKT)

## Usage

### Minting Tokens

Only the contract owner can mint new tokens using the `mint` function. To mint tokens:

1. Make sure you are the contract owner.
2. Call the `mint` function with the recipient's address and the desired token amount.

### Burning Tokens

Users can burn their own tokens using the `burn` function. To burn tokens:

1. Ensure you have sufficient balance.
2. Call the `burn` function with the amount of tokens you want to burn.

### Transferring Tokens

Users can transfer tokens to other addresses using the `transfer` function. To transfer tokens:

1. Make sure you have sufficient balance.
2. Call the `transfer` function with the recipient's address and the amount of tokens to transfer.
